# NLP-Disaster-Tweets

This repository contains two baseline solutions for Kaggleâ€™s [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) competition.  
Both approaches fine-tune large pretrained language models and attach a lightweight linear classification head to predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster.
